2018-09-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed bug where ss_alb_fct was set to 1.0 not to odsl/odxl for pure Rayleigh scattering atmospheres (neglected absorption)
	According to this ChangeLog, bug may have been introduced 20071215 and would have affected all simulations where particle scattering was turned-off

2018-06-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add slr_zen_ngl_dgr_cmd_ln to ease computations for Cheng

	* disotest and swnb3 work with above compile switch!

2016-12-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Define new native type r_ntv with PRC=N and/or by default
	swnb2 works fine with PRC=D
	swnb2 and swnb3 fail in rbn_vec() with PRC=F and PRC=N (also triggers IEEE underflow and denormal)
	swnb3 fails with with PRC=F
	disotest3 passes all tests with PRC=F
	disotest3 fails all tests with PRC=D, PRC=N

	* disotest3 passes all tests when compiled with PRC=S

	* Copy swnb2.F90 to swnb3.F90 to migrate to DISORT3

2016-08-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change real_tiny from 1.0e-10 to 1.0e-20

2016-06-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

2016-05-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verify everything works when str_nbr=plr_nbr. Yay!
	Fixes bug (negative reflectances and radiances) spotted by Xianwei Wang in ~2010
	It may also afix ~2008 bug comparing Adding/Doubling with DISORT reflectances
	Not sure, need to check

2016-05-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add CIE 1951 Scotopic and 1988 revised Photopic luminosity curves

	* Add broadband and spectral luminance diagnostics

	* Verified illuminance calculations are reasonable, ~120000 lux brightest sunlight

	* Add and verify CIE luminosity function I/O. Ready to compute lumens!

2016-05-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Diagnose radiances from DISORT2 uu array, not deprecated DISORT1 u0u array

2016-05-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add diagnostics for geoengineering study

2013-06-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Need to test how HITRAN 2012 changes swnb2 relative to HITRAN 2008

	* Updated ln_nbr_max, and re-ran htrn2nb on all SW-active gases	for swnb2

	* Verified swnb2 still works with HITRAN 2008

2013-06-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updating to HITRAN 2012

2011-04-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Alter Makefile compile and link to use nc-config --fflags, --flibs

2010-08-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Default to NETCDFF=Y and link to libnetcdff.a by default

2010-01-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cd;svn tag -c f-2.2.0 aca f (fxm)

	* Improve MPI compilation on greenplanet

	* Update CRM homepage location from NCAR to dust.ess.uci.edu

	* Fix uninitialized memory access bug caused by confusing flg_msm and flg_snw.
	Confusing because clm uses flg_snw in same sense that swnb2 uses flg_msm.
	Should be consistent across programs.

	* clm now writes multi-layer snow model data only when flg_snw is true.
	In netCDF3 a zero-length dimension for lev_snw has cascading effects.
	One is that zero-length dimensions are interpreted as the record dimension!
	But netCDF4 allows multiple record dimensions, so lev_snw and ... another

2010-01-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Replace declarations like "character src_rfr_sng*200" with initialization
	statements so that valgrind thinks strings are initialized when used.

2009-11-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change more occurances of _up to _upw

	* Fix more pedantic errors caught by GCC gfortran 4.4.1

2008-08-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Noticed (again?) that calday may have "off-by-one" error
	I remember this problem from years ago, not the solution
	CCM3/Bri92 solar zenith angle routines seem to require [0.0,365.0)
	Yet CCM CRM input format (that I wrote!) asks for [1.0,366.0)
	Perhaps lcl_yr_day=calday+1.0 and
	CRM wants lcl_yr_day and CCM3/Bri92 wants calday?
	In that case calday=t_local in CCM3/Bri92

2008-07-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Allow command line to set visible and NIR albedos two at a time

2008-06-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* This is, unfortunately, the same discrepancy as in early May
	However at least the code now makes sense
	In particular, CCY83 D/E computations all occur before DISORT

	* Discrepancy: DISORT albedo is 0.89 and two-stream D/E approx. is 0.98

	* Finish adding direct beam reflectance, transmittance properties

2008-05-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Start adding direct beam reflectance, transmittance properties

2008-05-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Discrepancy: DISORT albedo is 0.89 and two-stream D/E approx. is 0.98

	* Determine R and T for adding/doubling from CCY83 two stream technique

	* Changed definition of snowpack transmittance and absorptance

2008-01-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add stt_mie attribute for HG vs. Mie phase functions

	* Add stt_msm attribute for snow model

2008-01-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Differentiate between multi-layer snow model (--flg_msm) and
	snow constituent optical property (--flg_snw) activity. 

	* flg_snw is true by default and is back-compatible with atm-only files

2008-01-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Until mie computes PMOM correctly use g for PMOM(1)

2008-01-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* tst_case_HG also gives expected answers (with >~ 16 streams)

	* Verified tst_case_Ray gives expected answer

	* Remove -Q switch from most diagnostics (i.e., H2OH2O is off)

2008-01-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Aerosol/cloud properties now on ~10 nm grid by default

	* Change default cloud properties from old BPB lqd_10.nc/ice_20.nc
	to aer_h2o_lqd_rds_swa_10_lrz.nc and aer_h2o_ice_rds_swa_20_lrz.nc
	Necessary to provide newly-required phase function information

	* Compiles again after open heart surgery on phase functions

2008-01-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Simplified weighting of HG and Mie phase functions. Still buggy.

2008-01-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verified --flg_mie changes reflectance by an unbelievable amount
	Error is either in swnb or in mie program lgn_cff_xpn determination 

	* Output lgn_xpn_cff_Mie_ttl when used

	* Activate new functionality with --flg_mie

	* Segregated particle scattering into HG and Mie components
	Mie now refers to scattering fraction treated with Mie phase function
	HG refers to scattering fraction approximated as Henyey Greenstein
	
2008-01-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Symptom of inadvertently altered answer changes is
	WARNING >>>>>>  UPBEAM--SGECO says matrix near singular

	* Add stubs to use phase function moments in snow properties

2007-12-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cd;cvs tag -c f-2_1_0 aca f
	cd;cvs tag -c aca-2_1_0 aca f
	Changes since f-2_0_2, aca-2_0_2: netCDF3 works w/w/o snow
	Rayleigh scattering bugfix (changes answers!), flexibility

	* Always initialize (usually to 0.0) snowpack CWP/LWP/IWP/bga/aer

	* clm now writes netCDF3 files even if netCDF4 is available
	This will help avoid ${DATA_RT} repository differences among
	netCDF3/netCDF4 systems.

	* Verified netCDF3 and netCDF4 versions give identical answers

	* Do not write vertically resolved snow variables unless snow
	present. This allows swnb2 to work with netCDF3 again.

2007-12-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Turn off extrapolation of aerosols, clouds into snowpack by default

	* Fix regression from earlier fix where inadvertently was setting

	Changes since f-1_5_0, aca-1_5_0: Snow impurities almost work

	* netCDF3 non-snow mode temporarily broken by attempting to store
	more than one zero-sized dimension (lev_snw, levp_snw).

	* Impurity code now works

	* Fix plain snow last week sometime

2007-11-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Defined reflectance=0 where insolation<=0. Use missing_values instead?

	* Snow reflectance looks good red-ward of 0.29 um
	  Blue-ward of there, reflectances go haywire, possibly due to UV
	  attenuation of denominator (downwelling flux at snow).

	* Added eight useful snow diagnostics

	* cd;cvs tag -c f-1_5_0 aca f
	cd;cvs tag -c aca-1_5_0 aca f

	Still get "Floating point exception".

2007-02-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Deprecate underflow-trapping on ESMF. Just ain't worth it.

	* gfortran mysterious writes missing values into wvl_grd_rfl and rfl_spc_sfc
	I conclude that gfortran is buggy and breaks fl_rfl feature

2007-02-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Noted that swnb2 failures only seem to occur in double precision
	Some of these errors may be caused by using O2X which has numbers
	of O(10^-46) that require double precision
	
	* Remove azimuthal angle change in calls to Minnaert and
	LommelSeeliger BRDFs since they are azimuthal-independent

	* Remove wavelengths in calls to Cox-Munk, Hapke, Minnaert,

	(lf95) ncks -v flx_bb_dwn_sfc swnb.nc yields flx_bb_dwn_sfc = 505.709
	(g95)  ncks -v flx_bb_dwn_sfc swnb.nc yields flx_bb_dwn_sfc = 505.704
	Results were obtained with single precision swnb2
	
	* g95 swnb2 complains about unfree'd memory

	* Made clm text read g95-compliant

2004-11-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Typecast all brdf functions for g95 implicit-none compliance

	* Convert rt_utl.F to rt_mdl.F90, clm_utl.F to clm_mdl.F90

	* bdref.f (BDREF): Changed from bdref to brdf (bi-directional
	reflectance distribution function)

	* clm_utl.F: Clean up and use string module

	* swnb2.F,clm.F: Use string module everywhere

2001-12-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* swnb2.F,clm.F: Call getarg_err with alterable expression

2001-11-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c aca-1_1_3
	* cvs tag -c aca-1_1_2

	* swnb2.F (swnb2): Made alterations required to use fortran 90
	libraries instead of libcsz_f77.

2001-09-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Validated that new O3, O2X, clm, NO2, H2OH2O executables agree
	to within machine precision with old executables for default
	behavior. 

2001-09-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Converted O3.F, O2X.F, clm.F, NO2.F, H2OH2O.F, htrn2nb.F,
	clm_utl.F to allocatable arrays 

	* cvs tag -c aca-1_1_1

	* Implemented netCDF F90 interface. Routines compile but have
	not been validated.

2001-09-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_7
	1.0.7 is a synchronization tag prior to upgrading to netCDF F90
	interface. 1.0.7 is out of order since I've already tagged 1.1!

2001-07-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* clm.F, swnb2.F: Upgraded command line parsing to new POSIX
	compatibility 

2001-07-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* swnb2.F (swnb2): Updated aca programs to use ftn_ namespace
	routines put required with libcsz from f-1_3

2001-06-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Correct spelling is isotopomer not isopotomer

2001-06-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_1_0 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Changed mie2nc to use wvl instead of bnd for coordinate, and
	changed swnb to expect wvl dimension in ice and lqd files. 
	This allows mie() to generate valid ice and lqd files
	automatically, because expected dimension, wvl, is same as in aer
	files. 

	* Fixed mie2nc to read gsd and rds_ffc

	* Changed liq to lqd in filenames

2001-05-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_6 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Add --dbg long option

	* Update to CCM3 conventions by renaming 
	 alb_NIR_str_zen_ngl->alb_sfc_NIR_drc
         alb_NIR_weak_zen_ngl->alb_sfc_NIR_dff
         alb_vis_str_zen_ngl->alb_sfc_vsb_drc
         alb_vis_weak_zen_ngl->alb_sfc_vsb_dff
	This update means is backwards incompatible in that the new swnb2
	will only work with column profiles generated by the new clm
	
2001-04-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Expanded cmd_ln to 500 chars

	* Found problem in long argument/string parsing routines where
	--drc_in option only works correctly when compiled with OPTS=D
	and not when optimized with pgf90 compiler only. 
	Presumably strings are not zeroed with optimized version and this
	causes/exposes problems. 

	* Fixed bug in swnb suite where tpt_Malkmus_fit parameter was
	declared an integer 

2001-04-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_5 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Fixed htrn2nb to work when ln_lo = 0.0 cm-1 by redefining method
	of deriving wavelength grid fromm that particular value

	* Removed -Ktrap=fp from pgf90 Linux compilation since it was
	causing SIGFPE to dump core. 64 bit machines do not have this
	problem.

2001-04-19  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updated NO2.F so it works again

	* The crashes on Solaris and the Linux laptop were
	caused by exceeding soft resource on stacksize limit which may be
	set to unlimited with the command. 
	ulimit -s unlimited
	Placing this command in the /etc/initscript file is recommended.
	So the problem was not a software bug in the program at all, just
	in my environment.
	
2001-04-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Removed some superfluous dependencies from Makefile

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_4 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Removed last known instance of funny character strings so netCDF
	headers have no funny non-alphanumeric characters left. Any
	remaining weirdness in ncBrowse() behavior or core dumping is
	presumably not due to Fortran string issues involving buffer
	overwrites.

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_3 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Verified swnb2 and clm appear to work with new drc_in handling

2001-04-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tried to get rid of all funny characters from string attributes

	* Gave swnb2-1_0_2 to David Marsden

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_2 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Code works fine on SGI and Linux (dust), not sure what problem
	is on lanina and Sun

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0_1 aca c/date_time.c time f ck/htrn.c slr_spc

	* Re-added obtaining prf_sng from fl_clm

	* Switched to nf_open/close_csz() 

	* swnb2 still dumps core before reaching main fortran code on
	lanina, sun

	* Finished implemented --drc_in argument parsing to allow data
	files to reside in any specified directory

2001-04-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Removed special data directory for SGI, in preparation for
	adding long options getopt handling

	* cvs tag -c swnb2-1_0 aca c/date_time.c time f htrn slr_spc

	* Added helpful stop's to disort2 to warn about array size
	incompatibility 

	* Changed disort2.f memory consumption from 20 levels to 92 levels
	and from 48 streams to 16 streams

2001-04-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged aca-1_2 which appears to work on all OSs and has no known
	bugs 

	* cvs tag -c aca-1_2 aca c/date_time.c time f

	* Fixed problems on Linux where sending automatically-allocated
	arrays to putenv() in one function and then using gmtime() (which
	requires getevn()) in another function causes core dump because
	system does not allocate its own memory for putenv() arguments
	As noted in Linux putenv() man page, resulting behavior is subtle
	and best solution seems to be to allocate new memory each time
	putenv() is called. The total memory leak is small if a given
	program does not call putenv() too often.

2001-02-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added local and global upper and lower quanta to output

2000-09-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed certain band indexes, e.g., bnd_idx_lqd, that should have
	been threadprivate but were not. Now they are initialized in the
	parallel region so just being private is OK.

2000-09-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* OpenMP is compiling fine with default(none) on both IRIX and
	Linux. However, code now segfaults with even 1 thread. Bummer.

	* Noted that SGI f90 does not compile htrn2nb

	* Fixed OpenMP syntax for clauses on continuation lines

	* Made OpenMP loop default(none) and finished list of private
	variables 

2000-09-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Boosted max_nbr_aer_bnd from 200 to 1700 bands

	* disort2 prints temperature step warnings when tpt_dlt > 10
	This is common in 18-level profiles. disort1 only printed warnings
	when tpt_dlt > 20.

	* Finished OpenMP implementation by adding lists of shared() and
	private() variables. Unfortunately multi-threaded version has
	errors and disort() exits with "Input variable  UTAU  in error"

2000-09-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Compared swnb2 to swnb on mls_clr.nc. Difference in absorbed
	flux flx_bb_abs_atm = 0.00289917, and in surface insolation
	flx_bb_dwn_sfc = -0.000732422 are small. David say probably due to
	new disort2 Nakajima intensity method. 

	* Changed string lengths from 100->200 to beat down string
	overwrite bugs. IRIX f90 catches these problems and other
	platforms do not.

	* Improved optimization switches on SGI in Makefile

	* Changed default location on SGI to /usr/tmp/zender/aca

	* Protected OMP statements with #ifdef's for non-OMP compilers

	* Removed annoying print output from disort2

	* Added OMP directives to main spectral loop of swnb2

	* Changed default output file to swnb2.nc, fixed a few more string
	lengths 

	* Changed swnb to use d1mach and r1mach from disort2 
	Benefit is that swnb used to core dump when machine.F was compiled
	with optimization. machine.F is now obsolete so swnb now runs fine
	when compiled with optimization.

	* Moved utility routines errmsg etc. from machine.F to end of
	disort1 and disort2.

2000-09-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added TODO file so me and David Fillmore can coordinate future work

	* Donald Denbo, author of ncbrowse, informed me that reason for
	strange netCDF behavior on swnb.nc files is probably string
	related. Giving wrong long_name string attribute length to netCDF 
	is easy to do with Fortran. Apparently netCDF is unable to protect 
	itself from overwriting certain areas of memory when this is done.
	Corrected many string length routines, and now text attributes
	appear to work fine.
	
2000-09-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Modernized Makefile to be all F90

	* Fixed bug in cnc_H2OH2O_CFT99 that caused SIGFPE when RH_lqd=0.0

1999-12-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Fixed -M switch in swnb and nbm so that user-specified aerosol
	optical depths work from the command line

	* Removed f77 legacy IEEE and timing codes from all
	programs. Using f90 date_time() procedure instead.

1999-12-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Verified executable runs on two CPUs and that answers are
	bit-for-bit with single threaded version. However, there is
	absolutely no speedup so I am suspicious that OpenMP is working
	correctly. 20000917: Realized OpenMP was not working at all.

	* Added OpenMP parallel do directives to main spectral loop

	* Working on upgrading build environment

1999-12-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Fixed bug where htrn2nc.pl was writing HWHM_tmp_dpn_xpn but
	htrn2nb.F was reading HWHM_tmp_dpn_xpn.

1999-07-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Modified some of CRM text output routines to use explicit
	formatting in order to work with PGI F90 80 character limits for
	list-directed (asterisk) formatting

1998-11-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this version as aca-1_1

1998-11-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Changed default Malkmus narrow band size to 5 cm-1 for all gases
	except H2O. This changes answers w/r/t SWNB because O2 is now 5
	cm-1. 

	* Moved all Malkmus absorption computations into mlk_abs()

	* Added CH4 and N2O to nbm

	* Renamed swnb_new as nbm for Narrow Band Model to reflect its
	capabilit of running in longwave regions

1998-11-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Changed clm to use longitude in [0,360]. clm still works
	correctly with CRM files with longitude in [-180,180], but works
	internally in [0,360] domain wherever possible.

	* The new narrow band parameters are ~10% larger than the old
	Compared S_p_abs_cff_mss in mlk_H2O.nc vs. swnb_H2O.nc

	* Tested swnb_new against swnb with similar wavelength grids.
	Only difference in grids is outside H2O region where swnb_new uses
	regularly spaced bins rather than WMO85 grid. The two codes agree
	to within 3 W m-2 for atmospheric absorption and insolation for
	most conditions.

	* Changed from _int to _ntf for "interface"

1998-11-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added CH4, N2O, CFC11 and CFC12 capabilities to clm. Currently
	only use average column mixing ratios, and should upgrade to use
	vertical profiles when available, e.g., from AFGL.

1998-11-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Improved wvl_grd_mk() and added provisional -v -V -q and -j
	switches to support it

	* Using new vec_val2idx() and vec_set_real() functions

	* Updated swnb_new with recent swnb changes

Wed Oct 28 15:36:15 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged all files with aca-1_0, gave this version to Bill Collins

	* Removed setting gmt_yr=1995 and lon_dgr=-97 in clm since these
	variables are now part of CRM 2.x input files. The behavior of clm
	predicted slr_zen_ngl should be checked, e.g., against crm, for
	all longitudes and times of day.

1998-10-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Replaced obsolete nomenclature in clm and clm_utl and swnb

	* Added more error checking to clm and clm_utl netCDF I/O

	* Updated arese.pl and clm_utl.F to work with /data instead of
	/data2

	* Added -C flag to clm to discriminate between CRM 1.x and 2.x.
	Implemented this -C flag in arese.pl

Mon Aug 31 19:22:45 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Initial source imports should not compile because programs
	expect *.h Fortran include suffixes, which are obsolete now and
	should be replaced by *.com include files.

	* Created module aca

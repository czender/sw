Notes on Snow input:
Snow properties have some potential inconsistencies:

First, SWNB2 does not currently use layer SCRM effective radius at all.
SWNB2 takes its optical properties from mie output files.
These files have ther own independently-set effective radius.

Second, SWNB2 uses SCRM snow temperature for gas parameters, but mie
may have used inconsistent temperature for water refractive indices. 

Notes on Atmosphere input:
The Julian day of year, also known as the calendar day (calday in the
code), is always specified in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  For example,
1.5 is Greenwich noon on January 1st, 2.0 is Greenwich midnight of
January 2nd. 31.5 and 32.5 are GMT noontimes for January 31st and
February 1st, respectively. Longitude is specified in degrees east of
Greenwich.  The CRM uses the specified year, latitude, longitude and
GMT to compute the correct Sun-Earth distance and solar zenith angle. 

Latitude runs from -90 to +90 degrees, Longitude from 0.0 to 360.0.

The total number of levels must be the same as the PLEV and PLEVR
tokens in the file src/crm/params.h.
 
Pressure data is on mid-levels, like temperature, moisture, and
winds. The radiation code requires the interface pressures between
layers. These are computed as simple averages of adjacent level
pressures.

Dimensional units of input data:
Temperature is input in K.
Pressure is input in mb.
H2O and O3 are input as mass mixing ratios, 
Cloud cover is input as a fraction from 0.0 to 1.0.
Cloud cover of 1.0 is reset internally to 0.999, since cloud fractions
of exactly 1.0 cause the longwave code to fail.
Cloud liquid water path is input in g m-2 in each layer. 
Trace gases CO2, NO2, CH4, CFC11, and CFC12 are input as volume mixing
ratios.

Surface temperatures input are the air temperature in contact
with the surface, and the actual skin temperature of the surface. 

Surface type determines if the surface albedos specified are modified
before use. Over ocean and sea-ice, the specified spectral/angular
albedos are set internally. For land points, the spectral/angular
albedos read in are used without modification. 

Snow cover is used over sea-ice to help set surface albedos.

Fractional strong zenith angle dependent surface and surface
aerodynamic roughness are obsolete. They are only input to maintain
backwards compatability with previous CRM versions.

Important information regarding Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is
contained in the file AEROSOL.

Year AD must be input as an integer.

what i've done wrong:
should have parameterized the stratiform condensation completely in terms
of mixing ratios rather than IWP. 
i didn't because i was using IWP for the convective portion (which was
necessary, given that i was looking for relationship between a local Mc
and a total IWP)
however, parcel theory shows that the mixing ratio relationship avoids
introducing an unnecessary factor of density into the relationship.
Most of all, i shouldn't have decoupled the updraft and temperature
components of stable ice generation, because the physical mechanism
of vapor flux through updraft should appear in both.
My excuse is that if the temperature component depended on updraft,
then you couldn't get cloud formation for w=0 when there through
cooling alone. 
This is a lame excuse.
Should have made the temperature dependence based on the saturation mixing
ratio deficit, because i calculate that quantity in spcp.f anyway, so it's
available and qsat,i is what actually appears in the parcel model equations
anyway.
A major blown opportunity.

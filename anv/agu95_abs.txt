We have employed a cumulus ensemble model (CEM) to
parameterize the mesoscale outflow associated with deep
convection. Three steps were necessary to parameterize
results from the CEM into an ice water scheme suitable for
a GCM. Statistics from the GCM and the CEM were compared to
evaluate differences in dynamic response to similar large
scale forcings so that the anvil parameterization could be
sensibly mapped from the high to the low-resolution model.
Second, time series of the domain-averaged cloud water,
vertical updraft, and thermodynamic profiles were evaluated
to identify the most promising large scale predictors of
ice water generation and destruction. Third, a mathematical
formulation for the GCM thermodynamic tendencies was
formalized to include the most important physical processes
deduced from the CEM. We have also devised a
parameterization of ice formation under stable conditions. 

The combined convective/stable
prognostic ice scheme has been implemented into a new
version of the NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM2). One
novel feature of the convective parameterization is that is
predicts gridbox-averaged ice, thus circumventing the use
of a cloud fraction. The GCM response to the new prognostic
ice scheme indicates increased upper tropospheric heating
and associated acceleration of tropical easterlies.
Regional analysis indicates that ice water paths may be too
large at present. Results will be presented from an AMIP-type
simulation to determine the sensitivity of the current model to
tropical warm and cold events.

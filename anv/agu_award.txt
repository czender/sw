Charles S. Zender

I received my BA in Physics from Harvard in 1990.  While there,
interest in nuclear winter and ozone depletion curbed my interests
from astronomy to global change.  The next year I taught math and
physics at the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, ME.  I landed in
the Atmospheric Science Dept. at the Univ. Colorado Boulder in 1991.
I worked on radiative methods for ozone retrieval until coming to work
with my academic advisor Jeff Kiehl in the Climate Modelling Section
of NCAR.  In 1993 I received my MS on the topic of the radiative
sensitivity of tropical anvils to small ice crystals.  I am now
finishing my PhD, which centers on simulating the observed effects of
tropical anvils on the radiation budget using a new prognostic cloud
scheme in the NCAR GCM.  Future research interests include
identification of physical mechanisms causing radiation models to
underpredict shortwave absorption and effects of dust and soil aerosol on  
the global radiative budget.

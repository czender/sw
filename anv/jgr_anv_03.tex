Dear Dr.~Avissar,

Enclosed please find three copies of the revision of manuscript
JGRd-96152, now titled ``Sensitivity of climate simulations to
radiative effects of tropical anvil structure''.
The manuscript has been significantly revised to respond to the
serious criticisms of both reviewers. 

Reviewer~A raised numerous criticisms of the validity and clarity of
the new anvil parameterization scheme, together with valuable
suggestions to improve the presentation of the paper.
Both reviewers asked for clarification of the relative roles of the
prognostic anvil scheme and the ice fraction increase in causing the
model response. 
Reviewer~B suggested including an more background material on the CCM
cloud scheme. 
The revised manuscript includes two new figures requested by the
reviewers.
Their criticisms and suggestions are addressed item-by-item in the
attached responses. 
Thank you for your editorial assistance.

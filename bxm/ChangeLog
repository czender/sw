	* cvs tag -c bxm-1_2_3
	Changes since bxm-1_2_2: Replace symbolic link to bxm.jpg with
	the real file

	* Box model was breaking with log errors that suggested that the
	visualization of the bxm.jpg file was failing because bxm_vzn.html
	was trying to visualize a symbolically linked file
	(/var/www/html/dead/bxm.jpg was a link to /tmp/bxm/bxm.jpg).
	Fixed problem by copying bxm.jpg directly to /var/www/html/dead
	prior to visualization.

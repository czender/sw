Original directory: /home/zender/ck

This directory contains programs for correlated-k (ck.F) and
line-by-line (lbl.F) radiative transfer codes. 

Also, the htrn.c program decodes the HITRAN database and creates many
useful header files and even programs: 

../ck/hitran.F
../ck/hitran.com
../ck/hitran.h
../ck/hitran.pl
../ck/HITRAN.pm
../c++/htrn_c++.cc
../c++/htrn_c++.hh

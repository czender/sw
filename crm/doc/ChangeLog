2012-09-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Clarify licenses: CCM3 license for all CCM3 files is in LICENSE.ccm3
	CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license for all CRM-specific files is in LICENSE.crm
	LICENSE itself now describes the difference

2010-08-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verify netCDF3 and netCDF4 both build, link, and succeed at runtime on Linux

	* Verify netCDF3 and netCDF4 both build, link, and fail at runtime on AIX

	* Make PVM_ARCH == AIX report as CCM_TRG_FLG == RS6K

	* Make PVM_ARCH == LINUX report as CCM_TRG_FLG == SUN

	* Remove gfortran no-underscore switch in Makefile

	* Incorporate Javier Houspa's modifications to work with gfortran
	Essentially, this ports getmem.F and freemem.F back to crm-2.1.2

2010-07-06  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Verify netCDF3 and netCDF4 both build, link, and then fail at runtime

	* Update Makefile for better netCDF4 support, and AIX support

2009-08-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Hand-tagged and released as crm-2.1.5 using these commands:
	cd ~/crm;tar cvzf ~/crm.tar.gz ./crm;cd -
	scp ~/crm.tar.gz dust.ess.uci.edu:/var/www/html/crm

	* Makefile update:
	Pass -DLINUX instead of -DSUN on LINUX* machines.
	This works with gfortran and solves getmem()/freemem() problems.
	Thanks to Javier Houspa at Argentina's IMASL for hinting this.

	* Much earlier Makefile updates:
	New fortran compilers (gfortran) and switches, netCDF4 support

2005-12-15  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Updated homepage

2001-05-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added eight absorption fields to netCDF output:
	flx_SW_abs_atm,      ! [W m-2] Shortwave flux absorbed in atmosphere
	flx_NIR_abs_atm,     ! [W m-2] NIR flux absorbed in atmosphere
	flx_vsb_abs_atm,     ! [W m-2] Visible flux absorbed in atmosphere
	flx_bnd_abs_atm,     ! [W m-2] Band flux absorbed in atmosphere
	flx_SW_abs_sfc,      ! [W m-2] Shortwave flux absorbed by surface
	flx_NIR_abs_sfc,     ! [W m-2] NIR flux absorbed by surface
	flx_vsb_abs_sfc,     ! [W m-2] Visible flux absorbed by surface
	flx_bnd_abs_sfc      ! [W m-2] Band flux absorbed by surface
	Some of these are redundant with existing fields (e.g., fsns), but
	most are new and useful for quick diagnoses of absorption
	
2000-09-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added fsds to netCDF output

2000-02-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Found that mls_clr.out and mls_cld.out had accidentally been
	written using CCM4 flntc definition, causing small difference with
	CCM3 flntc definition. Re-wrote files using CCM3 definition.
	Tagged this release as crm-2.1.2, released without announcement.

2000-02-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged and released this as crm-2.1.1

	* Added workaround to cvs export problem in crm_dst.pl for cvs 1.10.
	cvs 1.10, which controls the CRM repository, can only export
	correctly to machines cross-mounted to /fs/cgd. 
	So this workaround only works on CGD network.

	* Changed Makefile to use environment $NETCDF_INC and $NETCDF_LIB,
	if available 

2000-02-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Changed mls_cld.in surface type to land to agree with mls_clr.in
	surface type. Of course this changed answers in mls_cld.out.

2000-01-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added missing lon loop to diagnostic flx_LW_up/down definitions
	in radclw.F to fix bug in diagnostics reported by Mike Iacono.

1999-09-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Added WDC's NOAA7 satellite NIR fields
	
	* Changed to CCM style Makefile with automatic *.d dependencies
	and enhancements to separate *.o and *.d files from source

	* Fixed dimension bug with odxl0_* and then was able to validate
	all new diagnostics

1999-08-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added many new diagnostics including vertical profiles of
	spectral optical depth, SW direct, diffuse, and total fluxes, and
	LW fluxes. Added vertical profiles of fluxes to both netCDF and
	text output. Not yet validated, SW diffuse looks too large at TOA.

1999-07-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Changed default orography from ocean to land, so that
	user-specified surface albedos are used exactly as input.

1999-07-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged ccm3_6_brnchT_crm2_0_1, ccm3_6_brnchT_crm2_0_2

	* The FAQ now answers questions about time, longitude, and the
	equation of time

	* Changed Linux default build to pgf90, validated against Sun

Fri Aug 28 10:58:44 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged crm-2.0-ccm-3.6 as ccm3_6_brnchT_crm2_0.

	* Modified files to describe new aerosol advisory in AEROSOL

Mon Aug 17 14:19:03 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Updated to ccm-3.6. SW answers are identical, some LW answers
	are identical, and some change up to the fourth decimal place,
	i.e., 0.0001 W m-2, in mls_clr.out values. This is expected due to
	the LW bug fixes that went into CCM 3.6, including the water vapor
	continuum overlap of nearest layer trace gas absorptivities, and
	the radabs longitude dependent fix. Thus, both the SW and LW ports
	from crm-1.9.0-ccm-3.5.22 to crm-2.0-ccm3.6 appear to be
	successful. 

	* Tagged crm-1.9.0-ccm-3.5.22 as ccm3_5_22_brnchT_crm1_9_0.

Tue Aug 11 14:50:46 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* crm-1.9.0-ccm-3.5.22 has been commited to the CCM CVS repository
	as ccm_brnch_crm. Both SW and LW fields were checked against CRM 1.16
	results where both versions of CRM used the identical mls_clr.in
	profile. The change in FSDS was 0.117 W m-2. This is smaller than
	the change expected due to the change in cosine solar zenith angle
	of 1.36e-4, which could account for up to about 0.185 W m-2
	discrepency. Then change in FLNT was 0.004 W m-2, which is not
	deemed significant. Thus both the SW and LW ports from CCM2 Omega
	0.5 to CCM 3.5.22 appear to be successful.

Wed Jul 22 16:17:33 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* CRM 1.16 has been released. Version 1.16 uses a new directory
	structure more similar to the CCM directory structure. There are
	no physics changes in CRM 1.16. The new directory structure is now
	under CVS control and this should facilitate maintainance of the
	CRM. 

Fri Jul 10 15:01:26 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed diagnostic surface radiation budget bug in computation of
	direct and diffuse fluxes. Aerosol and cloud layer optical depths
	were inadvertlently being assigned the optical depth of the last
	(18th) spectral interval. This caused large errors in the
	diagnosed diffuse/direct ratio. This only effected SRB
	direct/diffuse diagnostics and had no effect on total
	(direct+diffuse) fluxes, either spectrally or broadband. 
	This bug affected only CRM 1.13 (released March, 1998 and 1.14). 
	Fixed SRB version of CRM gets tagged as CRM 1.15.

Thu Jun  4 21:14:26 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed H2O continuum overlap of trace gas absorption in nearest
	layers. This required small changes to trcabn.F and radabs.F.
	Solutions change by less than 0.0005 W/m2 in the tropics at the
	surface. No changes at all above the troposphere.

Wed Mar 11 08:47:06 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Changed criterion for printing out SWCF ratio so that now ratio
	is printed whenever SWCF(TOA) != 0.

Fri Mar  6 11:44:13 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added FAQ to distribution

	* Added '-DDOUBLE' precision option to produce a double precision
	netCDF output file. '-DDOUBLE' should be specified whenever
	compiling the CRM with '-r8 -i4'-type promotion. 

Mon Mar  2 22:33:39 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Announced release of CRM version 1.13

Thu Feb 19 15:08:12 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Installed Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) module and common
	block. Cleaned up and reformatted output. 

Mon Nov  3 14:33:35 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Unannounced release of CRM version 1.12

	* Probably a netCDF3 vs. netCDF2 related bug appeared in ncvptg()
	in netcdf.F. Work around has been to define plon=plond=PLON=1 in 
	pmgrid.h and prgrid.h and use ncvpt() output routine instead.
	This has side effect of reducing most array sizes by a factor of
	four. Unfortunately, pmgrid.h and prgrid.h must now be maintained
	outside the default CCM source tree.

	* Starting this ChangeLog for the CRM. Everything before this
	entry has been merged in by hand.
	
Wed Jul 16 12:53:10 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Announced release of CRM version 1.11

        * Imposed aerosol extinction optical depth has been changed from
          0.12 to 0.14 in aermix.F. This resolves an inconsistancy between
          the CRM and CCM3.

Mon Jan 13 22:52:55 1997  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Announced Web page availability of CRM version 1.10 at CSM
	Atmospheric model working group meeting in Boulder.

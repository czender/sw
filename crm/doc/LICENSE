CRM and CCM3 Licenses:

Everything originally distributed with the NCAR CCM3 is
redistributable under the terms of the original NCAR CCM3 license,
contained in the file LICENSE.ccm3. Most of this was written by
Jeffrey Kiehl and Bruce Briegleb. The copyright holder is NCAR. We
call these files "the CCM3 files". They include all files in the CRM
distribution except those under the directories src/crm, doc, and bld.

Most files in the directories src/crm, doc, and bld were written by
Charlie Zender for the CRM. They were never distributed with CCM3.  We
call these "the CRM-specific files". Their copyright holder is Charlie
Zender. He is also the CRM maintainer. The CRM-specific files may be
(re-)distributed under the terms of the more restrictive CC BY-NC-SA
3.0 license contained in LICENSE.crm. This license allows use of the
CRM-specific files free-of-charge for academic and non-commercial
purposes. All other uses involving redistribution must obtain written
permission in advance from the copyright holder.  He may be contacted

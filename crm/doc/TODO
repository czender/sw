$Header$ -*-text-*-

1. Add eccen,obliq,mvelp input and output. The problem with this
is that CRM does not use namelist input. With a CRM input file
eccen,obliq,mvelp must always be input and some sort of key value
used to determine when to use them and when to use iyear_AD.
3. Remove empty directories?
4. Change $Header$ to $Id$

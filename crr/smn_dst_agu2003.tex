Dust accounts for more surface area than any other aerosol\\
Oxidant budgets may be sensitive to dust \cite[]{DCZ96,ZhC99,GCS01}\\
\begin{itemize*}
\item Up to 10\% \Ot, 50\% \NOt\ removed by dust!
\end{itemize*}
Problems with ``early'' studies:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item Uptake rate uncertainties (\textcolor{blue}{reduced?}, \textcolor{red}{still ${\cal O}(10^{3})$ for \HNOt})
\item Uncertainties not propagated to~\dlthchOt\ (\textcolor{blue}{quantified})
\item Most active \Ot\ removal paths unknown (\textcolor{blue}{determined})
\item Uncertain relative roles of photochemical, heterogeneous forcing (\textcolor{blue}{quantified})
\item No coeval dust, oxidant measurements in ``natural'' settings (\textcolor{blue}{much improved})
\item Simplistic or no mineralogical effects (\textcolor{red}{unchanged})
\item Inadequate representation of aging, surface saturation (\textcolor{red}{unchanged})
\end{enumerate*}

Subsequently, 
\begin{enumerate*}
\item Uptake rate measurements on ideal and authentic dust samples 
  \cite{USP01,MUG02,HaC01a,HaC03a,HaC03b}
\item ACE Asia, MINATROC, PRIDE, SHADE, TRACE-P
\item Global model \Ot\ sensitivity studies by
  \cite{MJL02,BiZ03,BiZ04} and \cite{BBS04}  
\begin{itemize*}
\item Effects of season, surface albedo, precursor proximity, uptake
path, uptake rate, chemical composition 
\end{itemize*}
\item Use of Inorganic Thermodynamic Equilibrium Models (ITEMs) \cite[]{MDKJ02,RoD041}

\item Photochemical forcing strongly sensitive to precursors,

\item Non-linear coupling causes $< 20$\% of dust \Ot\ forcing
\item Polar \Ot\ changes dominated by transport of perturbed air
\item Global annual mean \Ot\ decrease: 0.7\% (assumes $\mssuptcffHNOt = 0.001$)
\item Climatological regional \Ot\ decreases up to $10\times$ more

\begin{enumerate*}
\item Indirect mechanism (\HNOt\ removal) more important than direct
  \Ot\ uptake 
\begin{enumerate*}
\item Direct \Ot\ uptake \textit{may} exceed \HNOt-induced \Ot\ uptake
  (especially in Northern Spring) if 
$\mssuptcffOt > 5.0 \times 10^{-5}$ and 
$\mssuptcffHNOt < 1.1 \times 10^{-3}$.
\item \NOt~is also important in NH summer 
\end{enumerate*}
\item Uptake rate range of $10^{-5} < \mssuptcffHNOt < 0.1$ leads to
  \dlthchOt\ of $0.5$--$5.2$\% 
\begin{enumerate*}
\item Flawed models exaggerate \dlthchOt\ uncertainty
\end{enumerate*}
\end{enumerate*}

\rotatefoilhead{\bgl
\Large\textcolor{blue}{\hfill Future Prospects \hfill}}\vspace{-0.75in}\large
Reducing these order-of-magnitude uncertainties in \dlthchOt\ requires   
correct model representation of global dust composition, deliquescence,
and aging.
\begin{enumerate*}
\item Measurements: Target $\mssuptcffHNOt$ ($\mssuptcffNOt$, $\mssuptcffOt$)
\begin{itemize*}
\item Are surface area corrections ($\mssuptcff \rightarrow \mssuptcffBET$) necessary?
\item Characterize $\mssuptcffHNOt$ dependence on \RH\ and \CaCOt\ \cite[]{KGL03}
\item Systematize $\mssuptcff$ mixing and aging rules
\end{itemize*}
\item Models: Incorporate accurate source mineralogy
\begin{itemize*}
\item Remote sensing measurements of heterogeneous source soil
  mineralogy \cite[]{TSG02} 
\item $\mssuptcff$ mixing, aging, saturation, RH, \CaCOt\ rules
\item ITEMs with mixed-phase, internal, external mixing
\end{itemize*}

\item \CaCOt\ buffers aerosol \pH\ (important for soluble \Fe)
\item \CaCOt\ \textcolor{ForestGreen}{limits \HNOt} and \SOd\ uptake on dust \cite[]{DCZ96}
\item \CaCOt\ \textcolor{ForestGreen}{increases hygroscopicity}
\cite[]{KGL03} and likely \HNOt\ uptake (important for \Ot\ formation)
\item Disparity in measured uptake coefficients of \HNOt\
  ($\mssuptcffHNOt$) on authentic dust is $\sim 10^{3}$
  \cite[e.g.,][]{HaC01a,Gra02}
\item \Ca\ \textcolor{ForestGreen}{``accelerated aging''} may explain
  $\mssuptcffHNOt$ disparity, reduce uncertainty in dust-induced
  removal of $1$--$5$\% of tropospheric \Ot\ \cite[]{BiZ04}

Yes, this is a reasonable assumption.  In fact, the determination of
monsea-salt calcium was actually calculated from total calcium minus
seasalt calcium which I calculated as Na+ times 0.03825 (the Ca/Na
ratio in bulk seawater).

If there is enough seasalt, there certainly can be.  In fact, the
seasalt concentrations at Bermuda are not that high compared to some
other areas of the oceans.

I know of no better way to estimate seasalt calcium than from the
concentration of water-soluble Na+.

That assumption is as good as any and is widely used.  There is a
potentially significant problem in heavily polluted areas with a
significant amount of flyash since the major element composition of
flyash is very similar to that of average continental crust.  The
trace element concentrations might help to sort this out but the
results are not necessarily unambiguous.

This is a much poorer assumtion as the calcite and/or gypsum contant
of continental dust varies widely from one location to another.
Saharan dust collected over the Mediterranean Sea has much more
calcium than that collected over the tropical North Atlantic.
Glaccum's measurements of calcite + gypsum yields a dust calcium
concentration of about 2 at Barbados and 3-4 at Sal Island.  These
results agree fairly well with my estimates based on measurements of
nss calcium (from Na+) and mineral dust.

You need to look at more than the ratios.  A high ratio of total
calcium to total dust may be indicative of either a very high sea-salt
concentration (i.e. high sea-salt) or of a very low dust concentration
or both.  A low ratio would result from the reverse situation.  If any
of the concentrations are very low, there may be a problem with
uncertainties in the concentrations that are strongly magnified in the
ratios.

This brings up a problem that Rich and I and others discussed
extensively during several AEROCE meetings.  The NMSU calcium and
sodium concentrations are made with instrumental neutron activation
analysis and should therefore measure total sodium and total calcium
regardless of whether there is any insoluble component.  My analyses
are of the water-soluble Na and Ca components only.  In both cases,
nss Ca was estimated as Ca minus 0.03825 times Na.  My analyses of Na+
at Izana (virtually no sea-salt) indicate that Saharan dust contains
virtually no water-soluble sodium.  Hence the water-soluble sodium
should be solely a reflection of sea-salt sodium; that may not be the
case with Na from NAA if dust contains sodium that is not
water-soluble.  There is also a posssibility that not all of the Ca in
Saharan dust is water-soluble. 
Total dust at Bermuda was estimated from the neutron activation
analysis of Al in the manner that you have stated previously..

Folks: Just got back from a trip to Taiwan and I apologize for not
responding earlier.  However, I think Dennis has answered all of the
questions in about the same way I would have. 

The INAA data show that during  the high dust season at Bermuda, about
10\% or a little more of the monthly mean aerosol Na can be ascribed to
crustal sources rather than sea salt, but in general the
contribution of mineral dust to Na is quite small.  Again, be
careful about soluble vs. total Na, Ca, etc. 

There are some minor differences in the various references giving the
elemental composition of seawater, but the Ca to Na ratio shouldn't
vary by more then a few percent among them.  Also, at one point, there
was some discussion of possible enrichments of Ca due to bubble
scavenging and microlayer effects, but I think this too was resolved
as being relatively unimportant (I'm not sure that anything was
actually published on this after the effects of dust on the marine
aerosol were recognized.  My recollection is that some of the data we
collected for SEAREX showed a small, i.e., few percent, enrichment of
Ca in sea salt over seawater ratios, but I wasn't sure that the
analyses were accurate enough to make much of this.) 

There also are slight differences in the Ca and Al contents of crustal
material in the various compilations of data.  I usually use the
Taylor and McLennan data from the mid 90s.  As Dennis noted, you might
want to look at the Ca data with special attention to source region as
this element is more variable than some others.

OK. I was/still am doing a simple assessment of soluble Ca (as
measured by IC) vs. Al.  For Gosan, the correlation is very good (also
true for the other alkali/alkaline earths we determine.

Cement.

The Ca/Al ratio at Zhenbeitai, was about 1 (which is about the same as
in Chinese loess).  At Gosan, the Ca/Al ratio is a little lower, about
0.6, but I'm still working up the data so these numbers might change a
little. 

Thanks for the info.

My best for '03.

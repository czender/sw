Driving from the North (LA) or East (Riverside):
We are about 45 minutes from LAX airport and 15 from SNA airport.
Take 405S or 55W to 73S and exit 73S at Bison Ave.
(Bison Ave. is the last toll-free exit on 73S).
Turn left onto Bison and drive straight into UCI.
You are heading for the School of Physical Sciences.
At the third stoplight, cross Peltason and continue on Bison Ave.
Turn right into Lot 12a. If that is full, you may use Lot 16.
If you have a reserved parking permit, you may park in any space.
Croul Hall is the three story beige brick building with the glass
facade and golden-copper roof.  

Driving from the South (San Diego):
We are about 80 minutes from San Diego.
Take 405N and get off on the Culver Ave. exit.
Turn left onto Culver and follow Culver for about 1.5 miles
until you reach Campus Ave. Turn right onto Campus Ave.
and continue through a few lights until you reach Peltason Ave.
Turn left onto Peltason (Peltason turns into Berkeley Ave., 
so if you turned to the right here you would be on Berkeley). 
You may buy a permit at the parking kiosk on your immediate right.
Follow Peltason as it circles around the main campus. 
Turn right on Reines Hall Way into parking lot 12b, 
the first turn following the stop-sign intersection with Los Trancos.
All spaces in Lot 12b require parking permits except for about
eight metered-spaces on the immediate right as you enter 12b.
If you have a red parking permit, you may park in any of the
faculty/staff spaces (those with red signs requiring an AR permit). 
Croul Hall is the new, three story beige brick building with the
glass facade and golden-copper roof. 

Parking Lot 12a (not 12b) actually abuts Croul Hall. 
However, directions to Lot 12a are more difficult than to Lot 12b.
The entrance to Lot 12a is on your right as you follow Bison straight 
through the intersection with Peltason and drive past the dormitories.
Lot 12a requires reserved parking coupons as well.
Thus if you know what you're doing 12a is a little closer.
To play it safe, park in Lot 12b.
Lot 12b also has about 8 metered visitor spaces, on your right
immediately after entering the Lot. 

Obtain your reserved parking pass before parking in Lots 12a/b!
Pick up your reserved parking pass at the Mesa or Engineering Parking 
structures. These appear as "MPS" and "EPS" on this map:

After obtaining your permit, proceed as described above and park in
Lot 12b or Lot 12a which both serve Physical Sciences and Croul Hall:  

http://www.parking.uci.edu/wayfinding

The reserved parking pass will be under your or my name (check both).

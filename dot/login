# (like prompts for terminal type) to this .login file! Otherwise,
# batch jobs, which execute .login commands, will die right away.

# Bail out of non-interactive shells 
# Interactive shells are connected to a terminal (i.e., keyboard)
# Such shells return EXIT_SUCCESS (0) to the silent prompt of tty -s
# Non-interactive shells have no keyboard and return EXIT_FAILURE (1) to tty -s

# This following part tries to figure out what the terminal type is
# If the `tty` command returns '/dev/console', it assumes that the
# terminal is a sun.  Otherwise, it examines the TERM environment variable
# and the origination of the login to try and determine the terminal type.
# Failing all that, it will prompt the user for a terminal type.

# NB: In AIX, switch (`tty`) tries to execute the result of `tty` and fails

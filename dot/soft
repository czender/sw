# This is your SoftEnv configuration run control file.
#
#   It is used to tell SoftEnv how to customize your environment by
#   setting up variables such as PATH and MANPATH.  To learn more
#   about this file, do a "man softenv".
#
# csz++
# My .bashrc overwrites PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and MANPATH and thus loses SoftEnv paths
# To restore, do
# soft add +softenv
# man softenv
# To add packages, do
# soft add +nco-4.6.3
# To remove packages, do
# soft delete +nco-4.6.3

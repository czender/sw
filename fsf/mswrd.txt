I ignore documents sent in secret proprietary formats such as
Microsoft Word or Excel.
Propagating documents in proprietary formats has bad effects---
it pressures the recipients to use Microsoft software.
Whether intentionally or not, it buttresses Microsoft's monopoly. 
This stymies broader adoption of free software.
Free software promotes curiosity, creativity, and sharing.
Would you please reconsider the use of proprietary formats for
communication with other people? 

Please send me documents as plain text, PDFs, or in a free office
standard produced and distributed by groups such as these:

http://www.kde.org
http://www.oasis-open.org

"A non-free program is a predatory social system that keeps people
in a state of domination and division, and uses the spoils to dominate
more. It may seem like a profitable option to become one of the
emperor's lieutenants, but ultimately the ethical thing to do is to
resist the system and put an end to it."---Richard M. Stallman

	* gcm.pro (cntr_lvl_max): remove every other contour level when
	there are huge numbers (> 15) of contours

	* improved pnl_lbl automatic labeling

	* ibp_fnc.pro (label_maker_srt): fixed zero truncation in contour
	label problems

2001-10-17  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c idl-1_9_0
	Changes since idl-1_8_1: Revamped output formats and added
	new rasters: JPEG, PPM, PNG, and MPEG formats
	
	* ibp_fnc.pro (lgn_dst): MPEGS are working pretty well, but 
	date string needs parsing and title bar needs moving

2001-06-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c idl-1_8_1

	* Modified ncdf_varget_1() routine to accept two dimensional input
	variables and a hyperslab index. This enables psd() to work with two
	dimensional cll_fsh* variables from mie()

	* Renamed szdst to psd a long time ago

2000-03-14  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged as idl-1_8

	* Validated that psd_bch reproduces mie() exactly by comparing
	output of
	psd_bch,mmr_rsl=[3.64e-08,1.63e-07,1.28e-07,3.93e-08],prn=1,fmt_nsm=1,anl_flg=1
	psd_bch,mmr_rsl=[3.64e-08,1.63e-07,1.28e-07,3.93e-08],prn=1,fmt_nsm=1,anl_flg=0
	Note that validation requires using same number of size bins in
	psd() as in mie(), and same geometric standard deviations
	(usually either 2.0 or 2.2)
	
	* Finished implementing psd_bch

	* Tagged as idl-1_7

	* Making good progress on plotting size distributions

2000-01-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged as idl-1_6

	* Fixed some problems with countour labels and with plotting margins

2000-01-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Tagged as idl-1_5

	* gcm_xy now has nice hyperslabbing and dly and yrl modes 

1999-12-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Modified gcm_tv to work with daily data

	* Tagged as idl-1_4, ibp-4_1

	* Finished replacing most old nomenclature with new standards, got
	ibp and gcm working together again

1999-12-30  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added Makefile which has 'make tags' rule that looks at all my
	IDL files

	* Tagged as idl-1_3

	* Added lon_lev capability to IBP

	* Fixed bug with longitude labels in regional plots

	* Renamed lots of IBP variables

	* Tagged as idl-1_2

	* Working on adapting gcm_tv to daily data

	* Added AEROCE graphing routines

	* Removed lon,lev,lat ordering restriction for input data in IBP
	lat_lev and lon_lat routines. Dataset may now follow COARDS
	conventions and be lon,lat,lev

1999-11-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged as idl-1_1

# If this script is intalled as /etc/initscript,
# it is executed by init(8) for every program it
# wants to spawn like this:
# /bin/sh /etc/initscript    
# It can be used to set the default umask and ulimit
# of all processes. By default this script is installed
# as /etc/initscript.sample, so to enable it you must
# rename this script first to /etc/initscript.

# As per Jim Rosinski suggestion to get CCM running on Linux
# Sets hard (H) and soft (S) stacksizes to unlimited
# Without this command, RH Linux 6.0 defaults to 8 Mb for each
# With this command, stacksizes are effectively about 2 Gb
# Similar results may be achieved by typing "limit stacksize unlimited"
# at the csh prompt.

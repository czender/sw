This directory contains the files that you need to get ppp working with the
RAS connection on a linux RedHat box.  These files and notes were
generated by running a nice scripting utility called pppsetup-2.06.  
In theory if you already have a working ppp dialing script you should 
just have to: 

1) edit the chap-secrets file :
    A)replace 'jet' with your username
    B)replace 'your_password_here' with your RAS password
    C)place chap-secrets file in /etc/ppp
    D)change file permissions to 600 (chmod 600 /etc/ppp/chap-secrets)

2) edit the options file:
    A) replace 'jet' with your username
    B) replace /dev/modem with your modem device (may stay the same or be
       something like /dev/cua0,/dev/cua1,/dev/ttyS0,/dev/ttyS1,etc)
    C) place options file in /etc/ppp

3) change your dialing script to have chat just connect to RAS.
   Remove the parts of your script that pass lognames passwords,etc.
   Logname and passwords will be negotiated via chap-secrets file. 
   To connect to RAS you dial 4170804.  Start ppp as you normally would.  

If for some reason this doesn't work I've included dialing scripts 
that use chat to dial the modem.  Follow the steps below in addition
to steps 1 and 2 to use the generic dialing scripts.

==========================================================================

4) if your modified dialing script doesn't work use the one called
   ppp-go

    A) place the file ppp.chatscript in /etc/ppp
    B) place file ppp-go in /usr/sbin or /usr/local/bin
    C) make sure ppp-go is executable
    D) make sure that pppd exists in /usr/sbin if not change ppp-go
       to point to pppd
    E) make sure that chat exists in /usr/sbin if not change ppp-go
       to point to chat executable

    To use these as a non root user I just moved pppd, chat, and ppp-go 
    into an accessable spot like /usr/local/bin and changed the ppp-go
    script accordingly, but I guess you could also setuid root on ppp-go 
    to get things to work.


5) To connect to your service provider type


ppp-go      <-Make PPP connection.)
              
	or 

ppp-go -s   <-Make PPP connection, print messages to screen.)

You can use the -s option if you have /usr/sbin/chat from ppp-2.3.3
or later, otherwise you'll have to use ppp-go without the -s.


You'll hear and see the modem dialing then once connected,
logging you in Username: or Login: and Password: etc.

You won't see a Username or Login: and Password: prompt
if they're using PAP or CHAP to authenticate you.

If they use PAP or CHAP you'll just see CONNECT -- got it,
then in about 5 - 30 seconds if the PAP or CHAP negotiation
was successful you'll see the Local and Remote IP address
printed to the screen like below, you can press [Enter]
at that point.

CONNECT
 -- got it
About 5 - 30 seconds later.
205.115.312.56 -> 216.324.119.81 ppp0

If you run ppp-go in X windows you probably won't see a Local
and Remote IP address printed to the screen, you'll just see
the connection process come to a end, wait a few seconds and
press [Enter] at that point.

If you don't connect for whatever reason e.g. Failed No
Dialtone, Busy, No Carrier, Whatever, Exit, just press
[Enter] at that point.

if you have syslogd running, you can see the output messages
from pppd and chat in the /var/log/messages and or debug file.

Sample /var/log/messages file.

concord pppd[562]: Serial connection established.
concord pppd[562]: Using interface ppp0
concord pppd[562]: Connect: ppp0 <--> /dev/ttyS?
concord pppd[562]: local IP address 215.87.78.18
concord pppd[562]: remote IP address 205.94.97.35

You don't have a successful PPP connection until you
receive a local & remote IP address like above.

While trying to get ppp working I usually do a tail -f of the 
/var/log/messages file to see if ppp connects.

Just FYI

There is no support in linux for "WinModems", if you have a
WinModem you will not be able to use it in linux.

There is support for plug n play modems, if you have a pnp
modem you may need "isapnptools" to get it recognized.

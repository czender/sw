	* Ensure missing_value and _FillValue are, like variables, NC_FLOAT in output

2010-10-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add _FillValue to output file. Note that input files are
	still searched for missing_value, not _FillValue

2010-02-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Put netCDF4 handling in Makefile

2009-02-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change from GPL2 to GPL3

2006-08-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Add lat_fv as equivalent to lat array in CAM FV datasets
	lat_fv contains centered latitudes except at poles, where 
	latitudes are interface values (+/- 90). 
	Explained in e-mail message from Phil Rasch on 20060821.
	Note that: lat_fv is a true FV grid only for GSC grid type.
	Furthermore, physical quantities are still on lat=lat_ctr
	grid which is same dimensione as lat_fv.
	Hence lat_fv is not used as the coordinate for the rest of the
	variables in the file, which are centered on lat=lat_ctr.
	In other words, lat_fv is identical to lat=lat_ctr except at the
	poles, where lat_fv=+/-90. lat_fv can be made the lat coordinate
	with, e.g., ncrename -d lat,lat_fv in.nc out.nc
	
	* Fix slat definition and size to agree with CAM FV conventions

	* External surface data reading appears to work, roughly. 
	Some details need to be worked out like making topography
	consistent with glaciers.

	* Added sfc_typ_xtr_get() to handle reading in surface types from
	user-specified netCDF data file with, e.g., 

t	bds -x 96 -y 48 -m 23 --flg_sfc_xtr=T --fl_sfc_xtr="/data/zender/data/dst_T31_adams.nc" -o ${DATA}/data/dst_T31_crowley_foo.nc

2002-06-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-3_0_2
	Changes since map-3_0_1: All erodibility factors now default to
	zeroing at coasts and north of 60 degrees

	* Default is now zeroing north of 60 for all erodibility factors

	* Consolidate cst_tpr() and lcn_zro() calls in bds_prc()

2002-06-05  Dave Newman  <newman@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* cvs commit bds_drv.F90
	Now passing area to dst_src_flw (to accumulate area, not gridcells)

	Still need to do further small mods (e.g. read H2OSOI from lsmh_1x1.nc)
	* cvs commit geo_mdl.F90
	Big code cleanup.  Included code to accumulate area, not gridcells.
	Otherwise no substantive changes
	
2002-06-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-3_0_1
	Changes since map-3_0: Coasts, nothing poleward of 60 degrees
	Synchronize for Dave's area accumulation updates and coastal subroutine

2002-06-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Must archive areas rather than number of points for area_acm_fct

	* Changed default to remove all points north of 60 degrees

2002-05-20  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Change default to elimination of coastal any points with
	ocean neighbors as sources. This fairly significant change
	appears necessary with CLM vegetation, which is significantly
	more bare in northern Canada.

2002-04-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-3_0
	Changes since map-2_2_0: Too many to mention

	* Re-architected code into libmap, libbds, and bds frontend

2002-04-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* map.F90: Adopted new time stamping convention for input files

2002-04-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

2002-03-07  Dave Newman  <newman@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Fixed lat bug in dst_src_bsn, and increased basin size to 10deg (from 1000km)
	lat_dlt_m=lat_dlt_dgr*earth_crc/360.0
	real,parameter::bsn_sz_lon=1111.1e3

2002-02-07  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-2_1_5
	Changes since map-2_1_4: None, really. Ready for merge

2002-02-05  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dst_bnd.sh: Perform high resolution basin factor calculations

2001-12-31  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	precision usage
	
2001-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Replaced double precision with selected_real_kind(p=12) so
	those routines are independent of precision module

	* Transitioned all routines to use sng_mdl for string manipulation

2001-12-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dst_bnd.F90 (dst_bnd): Call getarg_err with alterable expression

	* cvs tag -c map-2_1_3
	Changes since map-2_1_2: Implement bsn_fct_hrz switch to compute
	basin factor at high resolution then regrid to model resolution

	command line switch for bsn_fct_hrz

2001-11-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-2_1_2
	map-2_1_2 is the branch point for map_dev branch

2001-10-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dst_bnd.F90 (map_prc): Program is now modularized and all
	#include's have been removed in favor of modules. 
	Still do not use precision module everywhere, however.

	* igbpdis.F90 (soi_chm_IGBP_get): Converted igbpdis to module

	* dstlsm.F90 (main): Replace dstlsm.h with dstlsm module from dust model

2001-09-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Makefile (FC): Added preliminary ifc support

	* Switched from dbg2 to dbg_mdl

2001-09-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Version 2.1.1 is BFB with 2.1 in all known respects

	* cvs tag -c map-2_1_1
	
	* dst_bnd.F90 (dst_bnd): Converted entire program to netCDF F90
	interface, added control module dst_bnd_ctl

2001-09-21  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-2_1
	Version 2.1 switches default bathymetry/elevation to TerrainBase
	User visible-changes: None

	* map.F90: soil_txt_get() puts ocean whereever lnd_msk_out is 0,
	not lnd_msk_in of greatest overlap cell.

	* hgt_sfc.F90 (hgt_sfc_get2): wrote hgt_sfc_get2() to parse
	TerrainBase bathymetry/elevation data. Seems to work great
	with current sea level. 

2001-08-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* tst.sh: Translated some bash'isms to work with IRIX /bin/sh

	* cvs tag -c map-2_0
	Version 2.0 appears to be robust on Tru64, Linux, IRIX
	User visible-changes: Default is to replace crops by forest crops
	
	* dst_bnd.F90 (map_out): Write pft as int not real

	* clm_fld.F90 (lai_get): Made /usr/tmp/zender/map the standard
	directory for file output and for diagnostics output

2001-08-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dst_bnd.F90 (dst_bnd): Moved all required input datasets
	that are not already in /fs/* directories to
	/fs/cgd/data0/zender/map. This includes the lsm_7993*, igbp_*, 
	and dst25* files.

	* cvs tag -c map-1_8_1
	Version 1.8.1 finally generates real LAIs and VAIs from new CLM
	datasets

	lon_grd was used in place of lon_ctr

2001-08-27  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dst_bnd.F90 (dst_bnd): Fixed bug introduced to sfc_typ_get()
	where mss_val was declared real

	* cvs tag -c map-1_8_0
	Version 1.8 implements new CLM LAI, VAI and has crop type
	replacement option

	* Added flg_set_crp_frs to set warm/cool crops to forest crops
	This surface type change considerably reduces amount of bare
	ground in northern Europe, midwest US in winter

	* clm_fld.F90 (pft_get): pft_get() and lai_get() run successfully

2001-08-24  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* clm_fld.F90 (lai_get): Finished time-stepping loop in lai_get()
	and added diagnostic lai_ttl_clm and vai_ttl_clm variables

	Version 1.7.6 completes pft_get() sucessfully

2001-08-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-1_7_5

	* Version compiles and runs but dies since gridpoints where
	(lnd_msk_out == 1 && lnd_frc_out != 1) allow fields to average to 
	lnd_frc_out rather than 1. Better if fields average to 1 and then
	fluxes get normalized by lnd_frc_out

	* tst.sh (err): Added test script suitable for NQS use
	This is intended to avoid ulimits problems on AIX and SGI

	* map_grd.F90: Added map_edge_mk() to derive interfaces from
	grid cell centers and domain boundaries
	(rnk_vec_gnr): Improved rnk_vec_gnr() to handle missing values and
	return number of valid rankings returned

	* map.F90: Fixed bug where calling routine was sending lnd_frc
	instead of lnd_msk to soi_chm_igbp_get(), soil_txt_get().
	Values were not used so no harm done

	* map_grd.F90: Added map_grd_anl() to help discern cause of
	map_area_get() not converging for earth_area when input grid is
	from CLM file

	* dst_bnd.F90: Formatting changes:
	Introduced sbr_nm
	Treating all dimensions in map_out() identically
	Replaced " with '
	
2001-08-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* clm_fld.F90 (clm_get): Segregated generic map functions into
	map_grd.F90 and introduced clm_fld.F90 for CLM input

2001-07-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* dst_bnd.F90 (dst_bnd): Upgraded command line parsing to new
	POSIX compatibility 

2001-07-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-1_7_0

	* Current version works at T170 so tag it accordingly!

	* map.F90 (lnd_frc_dry_get): Added fixer for rounding errors for
	wtl_frc_out and lak_frc_out ~ 1.0+1.0e-8 which showed up at T170.

	* dst_bnd.sh: Revamped script to process most frequently used files

	* map.F90 (hgt_sfc_get): SGIs appear to fail at high resolution
	unless ulimit -s unlimited is set, which is not possible, at least
	interactively, on dataproc.

	* dst_bnd.F90 (dst_bnd): Regenerated all dst_TXX.nc files so that
	diagnostic toms ODXC values will not contain errors.

	* Solaris machines inexplicably exit on error reading mineralogy files

	* Makefile (OMP): Restored default OMP=Y

	* Fixing the Bessel bugs appears to have fixed all the problems
	in generating high resolution boundary datasets.

	* map.F90: Changed write to unit 5 to unit 6 in soi_chm_IGBP_get()

	* bsl_zro_get: Change loop end from bsl_zro_nbr to
	bsl_zro_tbl_nbr_max to fix (probably harmless) memory
	overwrite. Problem caught by running with MALLOC_CHECK_=1.
	Problem affected only output grids with more than 100 latitudes.

	* toms_get: Fixed bad bug where odxc_prc was defined with input
	rather 	than output dimensions in toms_get(). 
	This appears to have been present for quite some time in dst_bnd.
	It may only have affected processing on grids where output grid
	was higher resolution than TOMS input grid (288x180), but I'm not
	sure. The problem would have shown up in diagnostics of optical
	depth, not in any of the boundary data fields.
	It did not affect dust boundary data file generation, except
	to cause it to fail on high resolution grids.

	* dst_bnd.F90: Appears to be dumping core in map_rbn after
	ingesting /data/zender/toms/toms_80_01.nc

	* Makefile: Updated and turned of OpenMP by default to see if that
	solved the problem of failing on T126. It did not help so OpenMP
	should be turned back on at some point.

	* dst_bnd.F90: Added abort on unknown PVM_ARCH. Changed arch SUN4
	to arch SGIMP64.

2001-02-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Notice that dataproc version stopped building, but krein version
	is fine

	* Changed NCAR versions to 1.6.2 for Natalie

2001-02-11  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c map-1_6_2

	* Commented out basin factor call in hgt_sfc_get() so basin factor
	from map_prc() is what is written to disk

	* Make some modifications to allow compilation with Sun F90 which
	is not very flexible about single if statements and string formats

	* cvs tag -c map-1_6_1

2001-02-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added copyright headers prior to distribution

2000-10-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Replaced sfc_typ dependence to with oro-dependence in
	dst_src_bsn() 

	* Moved call for basin factor from map_prc() to hgt_sfc_get()

	* Tagged this as map-1_6, last version prior to moving basin
	factor definition to high resolution grid.

2000-09-22  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Converted to Fortran90

	* Changed missing value for soil chemical constituents to 0.0 so
	the value will be valid when read in to global models.

	* Fixed new bug in dst_src_bsn introduced by previous fix
	mbl_bsn_fct produced ridiculous answers due to this bug.

	* Tagged this as map-1_5_0

	* Implemented Paul Ginoux's topographic based weights

1999-10-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@flagstaff.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added surface height data parsing for sfc_hgt,sfc_hgt_gpm,sgh,oro

	* Fixed bug where gw was input as scalar to netCDF output routine 

1999-08-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Changed default to missing_value outside IGBP world.img region

1999-08-03  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.acd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as map-1_4_0

	* Added 6 more geochemical tracers: Al, C_org, K, N, Na, P2O5.
	Revamped routine to work generically for any IBGP tracer.
	Tested using CaCO3 data for all tracers.
	
	* Added first f9X arithmetic syntax. Goodbye f77.

1999-08-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Added preliminary IGBP SoilData processing. First field is
	CaCO3. Not validated yet.

Fri Jun  4 20:41:54 1999  ZENDER CHARLIE 1445 ML CGD  <zender@dataproc.ucar.edu>

	* Added option to print soil texture datasets in CSM/CCM/LSM input
	format. Verified exact agreement when input is Webb. This allows
	users to choose to use the IGBP dataset consistently through the
	LSM and in the dust model.

	* Tagged this as map-1_3

	* Adapted code to dataproc, renamed soil texture variables to
	conform to dust model version 2 nomenclature, set IBIS soil
	texture to be default, renamed dry_frc to lnd_frc_dry

1999-01-28  Charlie Zender  <zender@flagstaff.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Fixed floating point overflow bug in map_prc() where
	missing valude odxc_tms data (=1.e36) could be divided
	by corresponding odxc_ccm data.

1999-01-26  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Tagged this as map-1_2

	* Verified that IBIS data does not change when output grid equals
	input grid

1999-01-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added ability to read IBIS soil texture files

Tue Dec 15 19:04:36 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added rlh_lsm (roughness length for heat transfer) and zpd_lsm
	(zero plane displacement height) and verified their implementation

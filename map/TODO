1. Make access to old external datasets like dst25, lsm_8589, toms,... optional
2. Create common block to allow various data directories to be set independently
3. Modify map_rbn or create new routine to reset slightly unphysical values (e.g., wtl_frc_out=1.0+1.0e-8) caused by rounding errors during rebinning
4. Streamline, subroutinize, and generalize conversion of latixy, longixy to lat_in_grd, lon_in_grd
5. Notify CLM folks that have better weight for pft_frc_out in heterogeneous cells
6. clm/src/main/areaMod:celledge_regional() assumes (incorrectly) regular longitudinal spacing on each latitude band
7. Compiling with OPTS=X causes compiler failure on SGI, but OPTS=D works
8. Running AIX,SGI causes core dump in hgt_sfc_get() presumably due to memory limits
11. SUNMP does not read '*' format float data in IGBP .srf files
12. Add option to specify change in sea-level and create land masks for, e.g., LGM
14. Replace csh goto statement in tst.sh with sh equivalent
17. Read soil texture from Sam's 5'x5' CLM2 netCDF file rather than my IBIS 1x1 degree file
18. verify new lnd_msk check in soi_text_get() works with CCM hgt routine and with MATCH/CCM
19. Use nearest neighbor algorithm in sfc_typ_get(), lai_get(), pft_get() for new land points which appear when MSL changes
20. Mojave, Dead Sea are ocean when flg_NGDC enabled since hgt_sfc_in < 0.0
21. Setting too many points to loam in soil_txt_get()?
23. Test and activate hyd_get() to replace mdl_lsm_get() and lsm_get_sfc_flw()
24. Code high resolution flow accumulation (which still may not work due to memory)
27. Implement map type structure containing lat_typ, lon_typ, lon_srt, map_dsc_sng, map_enm
28. High resolution basins appear to cause infinite loop in area accumulation:
bds --bkf_itr_nbr=5 -x 720 -y 360 -m 13 -o ${DATA}/data/dst_0.5x0.5.nc
bds: Computing flow accumulation factors at model resolution
ERROR: infinite loop in notLoop
29. Output basin ID to netCDF

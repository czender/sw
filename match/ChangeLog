	* Added match_vnl.sh to run vanilla MATCH (no dust)

2001-11-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* match.sh: Add 'CLOUD' to outfld() list for radiative forcing

2001-11-08  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* match.sh: Use absolute paths for rm,cp,ln to avoid aliases
	in interactive shell runs

2001-10-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* match.sh: Add rdsp link, change icdate to yyyymmdd

2001-09-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Makefile: make cln clears files in box model directory which
	are confusing global makefile when using relative paths
	(./obj/LINUX).

2001-09-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Makefile: Updated with new ALPHA, AIX builds and recognition of
	.F90 and .mod files 

2001-07-12  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added DBG option to Makefile to enable -DDST_DBG without
	changing dst.h

2001-06-25  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* match.sh: I just learned the hard way that a match (or ccm, for
	that matter) executable learns all its identity from the namelist
	file. Thus an old executable given a new namelist file will run
	and stamp tapes with the new CASEID, etc., but the executable can
	be old. This is what happened with dstmch62. It was really
	dstmch61 masquerading as dstmch62. This is one more argument for
	switching from namelist input to command-line switches.

	* Removed broken targets RS6K, SGI5, SUN4, SUN4SOL2 from Makefile

Wed Nov 25 14:16:53 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@sanitas-e0.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Added rmout,rmrst = .true. to namelist in order to allow long
	runs in /tmp/zender.

	* The reason the last version core dumped on Winterpark is that I
	was trying to do verticall interpolation from 28 to 18
	levels. Vertical interpolation is not implemented in MATCH.

Fri Sep 11 16:02:49 1998  Charlie Zender  <zender@odin.cgd.ucar.edu>

	* Implemented initial version of MATCH Dust module from MATCH
	3.2.8. This version builds and runs MATCH 3.2.8 correctly on Cray
	machines, but core dumps on Winterpark for unknown reasons.
	There are no specific modifications to use Dust routines, although
	the params.h file has been modified to accept Dust tokens.

2005-08-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Fixed (possibly longstanding) bug where specifying gcc to
	cmp_chg.sh did not have intended effect

2004-05-09  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: Changed intermediary to from dataproc:/ptmp to
	goldhill:/tmp to avoid new security perimeter

2003-12-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* bck_zender.sh (tar_fl): Do not use tar -v or --verbose since logs are ~1 MB

2003-07-01  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: Added command line parser/printer

2003-03-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cmp_chg.sh (cmp): Finished cmp_chg.sh, which seems to work

2002-04-16  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* cvs tag -c sh-1_2
	Changes since sh-1_1: Reduced storage overhead by removing history
	tapes when netCDF data are archived, improved rdsp compatibility

	* Changed behavior to delete history tapes if they were converted
	to netCDF, thus avoid storing redundant data.

	* msrcp.pl: Added -d behavior to rdsp. This deletes local file
	after archiving. 

2002-04-04  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: Rewrote mss_lcl logic to be less confusing and cause
	NCAR writes to always go to real MSS

2002-01-09  Dave Newman  <newman@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: /usr/tmp changed to /ptmp on dataproc.ucar.edu

2001-12-07  Dave Newman  <newman@uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: Modified to run as user other than zender

2001-11-10  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: Got rid of "_" file test shortcut WCO00 p. 99

2001-10-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* msrcp.pl: Allow invocation with rdsp to follow mswrite logic

2001-08-23  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* tst_bsh.sh: Fixed minor bugs

2000-01-13  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Added ability of msread to fall through to NCAR MSS if local
	read is unsuccessful

1999-12-29  Charlie Zender  <zender@uci.edu>

	* Altered msrcp.pl to redirect mswrite's to local disk on certain machines

1999-11-02  Charlie Zender  <zender@dust.ps.uci.edu>

	* Tagged sh-1_1

	* Changed mswrite.sh to automatically attempt to convert file to
	netCDF and store that on NCAR MSS as well. This makes mswrite only
	useful for CCM history tapes. msrcp.pl should be used for more
	general functionality.

1999-01-18  Charlie Zender  <zender@z.ppp.ucar.edu>

	* Began CVS repository for system scripts, tagged as sh-1_0

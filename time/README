This directory, ${HOME}/time/README, contains data and programs 
related to the computation of time (UNIX time, GMT time, local time),
Sun-Earth geometry (including solar zenith angle).

time.txt	Terminology and conventions in my programs	  
time_gmt2unix.c Converts GMT to UNIX time (hardcoded)
time_unix2gmt.c Converts UNIX to GMT time (accepts command line input) 
time_diff.c	Computes difference (in s) between two dates.
		Demonstrates use of mktime() and difftime()
time_tst.c	Test conversions between GMT time and UNIX time
		Demonstrates use of tzset(), timegm(), gmtime()
slr_crd_wac.pro IDL routines to compute solar geometry from Bill
		Collins  

Joseph J. Michalsky sent me fortran programs for computing Sun-Earth
geometry. His original program and my translation of it are in

slr_crd_jjm.orig       Original file from JJM
slr_crd_jjm.F	Driver program for JJM's method
slr_crd_utl.F	Subroutines for JJM's method
~/f/slr_crd_mdl.F Fortran90 version of slr_crd_utl.F

NB: date_time.c in module c (${HOME}/c) implements C-subroutines
which facilitate Fortran access to C date and time functions. 
These functions are derived from and _nearly_ identical to the
functions developed in the time directory programs. 
It would be nice to use the exact same functions both here and in
date_time().
